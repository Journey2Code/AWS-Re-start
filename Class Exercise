# Ask the user for two numbers:
number1 = float(input("Please enter your first number? "))
number2 = float(input("Please enter your second number? "))

#Multiplies the numbers together:
answer2 = float(number1) * float(number2)

#Prints the answer in both an integer and a float:
print(answer2)
print(int(answer2))
